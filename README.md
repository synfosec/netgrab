# netgrab

netgrab is a versatile shell script designed for multithreaded network scanning. When using netgrab, you input the first three octets of an IP address, such as 192.168.1, excluding the last number. The script then efficiently scans all hosts within the specified /24 network, making it a powerful tool for network reconnaissance.
